# trading-arbitrage-algorithms
This repo stores my developments related to automated trading algorithms from my time working for the largest Argentine broker. I automated manual processes for the trading desk, improving efficiency and gradually transitioning the team into a Business Intelligence-oriented group, which I eventually led.

NOTE: This repo contains only files related to this specific objective and may lack the higher-level engine, as these resources were part of a larger software system I created. The purpose of this repo is not to provide a ready-to-use solution but to demonstrate my ability to build software relevant to its title.
